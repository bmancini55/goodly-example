# goodly hello world
This project will help you get familiar with writing goodly servics.

## Getting started

From the `hello-world` directory, start by installing the node dependencies
```sh
npm install
```

Once the node dependencies are installed, and with RabbitMQ running, you can start the services from NPM scripts:

```sh
npm run example1 192.168.99.100
npm run example2 192.168.99.100
npm run example2 192.168.99.100
npm run example2 192.168.99.100
npm run example2 192.168.99.100
```
